Coffee and the American Revolution
While coffee was available in colonial America, tea was the preferred drink until 1773. The heavy taxation on tea imposed by the British Parliament, culminating in the Tea Act, led to the famous Boston Tea Party. During this protest, colonists dumped 342 chests of British tea into the Boston Harbor.

Following this event, drinking tea became seen as unpatriotic. Coffee replaced tea as the beverage of choice for revolutionaries. John Adams, in a letter to his wife Abigail, wrote of his resignation to drinking coffee instead of tea as a patriotic duty. This shift helped cement coffee's place in American culture.

Civil War and Expansion
During the American Civil War, coffee was a staple ration for Union soldiers, who were issued 36 pounds of coffee a year. It was often brewed in camp kettles and was considered essential for morale and alertness. The phrase "cup of Joe" is sometimes (though likely incorrectly) attributed to Josephus Daniels, a Secretary of the Navy who banned alcohol on ships, leaving coffee as the strongest drink available, but it more likely refers to the common soldier's drink. By the late 19th century, large roasters like Hills Bros. and Maxwell House began vacuum-packing coffee, making it a household staple across the expanding nation.
