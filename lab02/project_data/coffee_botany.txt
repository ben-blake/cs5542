Coffee Botany: Arabica vs. Robusta
The two most commercially important species of coffee are *Coffea arabica* and *Coffea canephora* (commonly known as Robusta).

Coffea Arabica
Arabica accounts for about 60-70% of the world's coffee production. It originated in the highlands of Ethiopia and thrives at higher altitudes (2,000 to 6,000 feet) with cool, subtropical climates. Arabica beans are generally considered to have a superior flavor profile—smoother, more acidic, and with complex notes of fruit, sugar, and berries. However, the Arabica plant is delicate, susceptible to pests like the coffee berry borer and diseases like coffee leaf rust.

Coffea Canephora (Robusta)
Robusta is hardier and can grow at lower altitudes in hotter climates. It contains nearly twice as much caffeine as Arabica and more chlorogenic antioxidants. This high caffeine content acts as a natural pesticide, making the plant more resistant to pests and disease. However, the flavor is often described as harsh, grainy, or rubbery, with a bitter aftertaste. Robusta is commonly used in espresso blends to produce a thick crema and in instant coffee production due to its lower cost and stronger body.
