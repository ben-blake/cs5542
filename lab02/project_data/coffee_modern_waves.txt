The Waves of Coffee
The history of modern coffee consumption is often described in "waves."

First Wave (1800s - 1960s)
The First Wave was characterized by the mass production and consumption of coffee. Brands like Folgers and Maxwell House made coffee a cheap, accessible commodity found in every American household. The focus was on convenience, vacuum packaging, and instant coffee, rather than quality or origin.

Second Wave (1970s - 1990s)
The Second Wave marked a shift towards enjoying specialty coffee and the "coffee shop" experience. Companies like Peet's Coffee and Starbucks introduced darker roasts and espresso-based drinks (lattes, cappuccinos) to the mainstream. This wave emphasized the social aspect of coffee and educated consumers about roasting styles and basic origins.

Third Wave (2000s - Present)
The Third Wave treats coffee as an artisanal foodstuff, similar to wine or craft beer. The focus is on the specific bean origin, the farmer, the processing method, and lighter roasts that highlight the bean's natural characteristics. Brewing methods like pour-over (V60, Chemex) became popular. Third-wave roasters emphasize transparency, fair trade, and sustainability.

Fourth Wave?
Some argue we are entering a Fourth Wave, characterized by scientific precision in brewing, sustainable sourcing in the face of climate change, and high-end "cold brew" innovations.
