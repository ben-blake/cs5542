Gabriel de Clieu and the Caribbean
In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young coffee plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered it to be planted in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In 1723, a young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu, obtained a seedling from the King's plant. Despite a challenging voyage — involving storms, a saboteur who tried to destroy the seedling, and a water shortage — de Clieu managed to transport it safely to Martinique.

Once planted, the seedling not only thrived, but it's credited with the spread of over 18 million coffee trees on the island of Martinique in the next 50 years. Even more incredible is that this seedling was the parent of all coffee trees throughout the Caribbean, South and Central America.

The Rise of Brazil
The Portuguese wanted a cut of the coffee market, but French Guiana was guarding its coffee plantations heavily. In 1727, Francisco de Melo Palheta was sent by the emperor of Brazil to French Guiana to get coffee seeds. He couldn't find a way to get them until the French Governor's wife, captivated by his good looks, gave him a large bouquet of flowers before he left. Buried inside were enough coffee seeds to begin what is today a billion-dollar industry.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Brazil had become the world's largest producer of coffee, a title it still holds today. The mass production in Brazil helped lower the price of coffee, making it accessible to the working class worldwide, not just the elite.
