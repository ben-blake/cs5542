Coffee in the Ottoman Empire
By the 16th century, coffee had become an integral part of Ottoman culture. The first coffeehouse in Istanbul opened in 1555, brought by two Syrian merchants. These establishments quickly proliferated, becoming social hubs where men gathered to socialize, do business, and exchange news. The Ottoman court even had a specific official, the "Kahvecibaşı" (Chief Coffee Maker), who was responsible for brewing the Sultan's coffee.

The method of preparation—finely ground beans boiled with water and sugar in a "cezve" (pot)—became known as Turkish coffee. It was served unfiltered, with the grounds settling at the bottom of the cup. Fortune telling by reading the grounds (tasseography) also became a popular tradition.

Despite its popularity, coffee faced religious and political scrutiny. Some clerics argued that roasting beans to charcoal made them haram (forbidden). Sultans like Murad IV feared that coffeehouses allowed for political dissent and sedition to spread unchecked. Murad IV went as far as banning coffee and tobacco, with penalties including death for those caught consuming them. However, the habit was too deeply ingrained, and subsequent rulers eventually lifted the bans, opting instead to tax the lucrative trade.
