The Legend of Kaldi
The most popular origin story of coffee traces back to a goat herder named Kaldi, who lived in the Ethiopian plateau around the 9th century (though written accounts appear much later). Legend says Kaldi noticed his goats became unusually energetic and wouldn't sleep at night after eating red berries from a certain tree.

Kaldi reported this to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.

Spread to Yemen
From Ethiopia, coffee made its way across the Red Sea to Yemen. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia. It was here that coffee cultivation began in earnest. The drink was known as "qahwa" (which originally meant wine). Sufi monasteries in Yemen used coffee to stay awake during nightly devotions. By the 16th century, it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.

Coffee Houses in the Middle East
Coffee houses, known as "qahveh khaneh," began to appear in cities across the Near East. They became centers of social activity where people drank coffee, played chess, and discussed the news of the day. Because of the lively discussions, they were sometimes referred to as "Schools of the Wise."
