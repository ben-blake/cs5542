Arrival in Europe
European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an unusual dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the continent. Some people reacted to this new beverage with suspicion or fear, calling it the "bitter invention of Satan." The local clergy condemned coffee when it came to Venice in 1615. The controversy was so great that Pope Clement VIII was asked to intervene. He decided to taste the beverage for himself before making a decision. He found the drink so satisfying that he gave it papal approval.

Coffee Houses in London and Paris
Coffee houses quickly became centers of social activity and communication in the major cities of England, Austria, France, Germany, and Holland. In England, "penny universities" sprang up, so called because for the price of a penny one could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in stimulating conversation. By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses in London, many of which attracted like-minded patrons, including merchants, shippers, brokers, and artists.

Attempted Bans
Despite its popularity, coffee faced opposition. In 1675, King Charles II of England issued a proclamation attempting to suppress coffee houses, arguing they were places where "false, malicious, and scandalous reports are devised and spread abroad." The public outcry was so great that the ban was withdrawn just weeks later. Similarly, in Mecca in 1511 and Constantinople (later Istanbul), rulers occasionally tried to ban coffee due to its stimulating effects or the political gathering nature of coffee houses, but these bans rarely lasted long.
